## The Right Tool

This blog was created with Jekyll which is a static site generator written in Ruby. I considered using a CMS like Wordpress but in the end I chose Jekyll for a few reasons. The benefits of Jekyll are that it is fast, secure, and lightweight when compared to a tool like a CMS such as Wordpress. So how does Jekyll provide these advantages?

## The Short Answer 

Jekyll generates static sites!

## The Long Answer

Jekyll is a tool that precompiles a website that can then be hosted with fewer resources than a CMS. Wordpress, like all content management systems, must make a call to it's database every time a request is made by a user.

In fact, the main benefit's of Jekyll are a direct effect of it not having a database.

1. It is fast because there are no queries to a database to process.

2. It is secure because there is no database to disrupt with SQL injection or other methods.

3. It is light in terms of resources because the heavy lifting is done by Jekyll before it is hosted on the web. This is a reference to the precompiling I was talking about before. A folder named _site is where the website to be hosted is precompiled into and stored. It is because Jekyll is so light on resources that it can be hosted for free on Github Pages.

## In Conclusion

When it comes to making anything you want to make sure you choose the right tool for the job and in the case of my blog Jekyll fits the bill.
