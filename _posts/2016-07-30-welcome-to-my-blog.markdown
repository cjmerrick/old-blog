Hi, I'm Chris and I'd like to personally welcome you to my blog. The topics I write about on this blog will focus on the state of web development today and where it is headed, programming languages and frameworks,  and I will also share the projects I am working on and what I learn along the way.

I hope you find this blog informative and entertaining but most of all I hope you get some real value from it. I appreciate all opinions and feedback from my readers so please leave a comment below if you like. 

I hope you learn from my successes, learn from my mistakes, stay curious, and question everything.
