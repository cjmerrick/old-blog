# It's been awhile!

Hey sorry it's been awhile since I've posted anything. But from now on it will be on a more regular basis. Hopefully.

# What have I been up to?

The last month or so I have been focused on doing freelance web development work. Mostly with Wordpress which I have come to absolutely love. Although it has features that people love to bitch about, it's positives outweigh it's negatives by a long shot. Also the fact that it is the engine that runs roughly one-fifth of the internet speaks for itself. There's more bitching about it because more people use it.

Besides the freelance work I have been doing I have started a business, <a href="http://www.smartsitedevanddesign.com">Smart Site Dev and Design</a>.

# Why start Smart Site?

 My reason for starting this business was that I enjoyed taking the stress of creating an online business presence away from business owners, and wanted to help them make wise marketing decisions with analytics. As of right now Smart Site specializes in creating customized Wordpress websites, but we are also currently working on the online marketing and analytics aspect of the business and look forward to implementing it soon!

# What Next?

At this point I am extremely busy getting the business and my website set up while still actively doing contract work. When I have free time I am developing the Online Marketing and Analytics side of the business to be ready to help businesses of any size increase the return they see on their marketing budget. I also am working on a MEAN Stack Project which I will be posting on here soon including the link to the code.

I plan to write much more often from now on so lets see if I can stick to my word. Drop me a comment if you have any questions, suggestions, or advice when it comes to the business. Until next time thanks everyone and have a great day.
