Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm a Web Developer based out of Fresno, California. I am always working on projects that expand my knowledge of Web Development, Computer Science, and Web Design and I use this blog as a way to document and share what I learn.

I would like to hear from anyone who enjoys my blog, learns from it, or wants to correct me. If you want to get in touch with me leave a comment on the blog or email me at cmerrick@mail.fresnostate.edu.
