Hi my name is Chris and I am a web developer that is constantly seeking a better understanding of all things pertaining to a web development. 

I am excited to have the opportunity to share my learning experience with you through this blog. When I think about the real value the internet provides to us all it's not just the vast information that is only a google search away. I think about the ability we have in the modern world to communicate like never before. Communication and discussion of thoughts and ideas is where the real value of the internet resides. So please feel free to leave me a comment or email me, I would love to hear from anyone who enjoys my blog, finds value in it, or has contructive feedback for me.
